description: Our final assignment, combining everything we've learned at NSS so far.  I decided to make 'Which___?' - a site where users can anonymously upload two items and have the community vote on which they like more.  The uploader can see the actual vote count on 'Whiches' he/she has submitted.  Built using AngularJS, jQuery, C#, Entity Framework, and a code first approach to creating databases.
