description: One of our earliest "deep dives" in Javascript.  At the time, for loops, tables, and if-else statements were are still brand new and this was our push into the deep end.  Everyone has seen Conway, so this is my chance to air some dirty (code) laundry from my early days.  Look at all those comments and giant functions.  *shudder*
